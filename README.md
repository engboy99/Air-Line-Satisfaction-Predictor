# Air-Line-Satisfaction-Predictor

# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to analyze and predict airline passenger satisfaction using machine learning techniques. We utilize a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle that includes various factors influencing passenger satisfaction, such as seat comfort, service quality, in-flight amenities, and more. The goal is to identify the key drivers of satisfaction and develop a predictive model to assist airlines in enhancing their services. 

We will compare the performance of two machine learning algorithms, **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, to determine the most effective model for this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset**, available on Kaggle. It contains data on various factors affecting passenger satisfaction.

- **Dataset Link**: [Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

### Original Number of Features in the Dataset:
- 24 features (excluding the target variable)

### Target Variable:
- **Satisfaction** (for Supervised Learning)

## Problem Type

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Classification Problem**

## Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms were applied in this project:

### Algorithm 1: Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks. It is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets with ease.

### Algorithm 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a powerful classification technique that finds the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into different classes. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and works well in classification tasks with complex decision boundaries.
